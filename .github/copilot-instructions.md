# AI Agent Instructions for Fragrance Encyclopedia for Dummies

## Project Overview
This is a web-based encyclopedia project designed to provide simple, accessible information about fragrances and perfumery. The project uses a minimal tech stack with vanilla HTML/CSS for maximum simplicity and accessibility.

## Architecture & Structure
- Single-page application built with vanilla HTML/CSS
- No external dependencies or build process required
- Inline CSS styling in the `index.html` file
- Mobile-responsive design using flexbox

## Design Patterns & Conventions

### Color Scheme
The project uses a consistent pastel color palette:
- Background: `#f8e6e6` (Light green pastel)
- Container background: `#fff5f5` (Very light green)
- Headings: `#9b6b9d` (Pastel blue)
- Accent text: `#87a9c7` (Pastel cyan)
- Regular text: `#707070` (Black)

### CSS Conventions
- BEM-like class naming convention for components
- Flexbox for layout and centering
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Border-radius of 20px for container elements
- Consistent box-shadow: `0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`

### Typography
- Font family: Arial with sans-serif fallback
- Base font size: 1.1rem for body text
- Line height: 1.6 for optimal readability

## Development Workflow
1. Edit the `index.html` file directly - no build process needed
2. Test changes by opening the HTML file in a web browser
3. Changes are immediately visible without compilation

## Common Tasks
- To add new content sections, use the existing container structure as a template
- For styling variations, follow the established color scheme
- Use the `accent` class to highlight important terms

## Project-Specific Notes
- Keep language simple and accessible for beginners
- Break down complex perfumery concepts into easy-to-understand explanations
- Use semantic HTML elements for better accessibility
